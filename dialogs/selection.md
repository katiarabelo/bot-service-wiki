# Dialog Selection

When a user begins interacting with a Chatbot, we must first decide which [Dialog](/wiki/dialogs) to respond.  Every Chatbot assigns a "First Dialog" badge to one and only one of their Dialogs.  This is the Dialog which will be used as the initial seed to all conversations.

See our page on the [Multiplexer Dialog](/wiki/dialogs/multiplexer) if you're looking to use more advanced logic.
