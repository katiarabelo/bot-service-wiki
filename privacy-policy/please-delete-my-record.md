# Please Delete My Record

All Chatbots created with our system have an override command which you can use to erase data it has stored about you at any time.  At any point in a conversation, you can tell one of our Chatbots to "please delete my record".

If at any time, a user sends the message "please delete my record" to a Bot, the [Conversation State](../getting-started/conversation-state) will be cleared.  This Bot's creator has no ability to disable this functionality.  The Bot's creator may have back-ups of this data, which they will be asked to clear as well.

The user will recieve a confirmation response "Memory has been erased."

Be advised that users of our system have some options to replicate data in and out of our Chatbot's Knowledge Base.
