# Privacy Policy

All Chatbots created with our system have an override command which you can use to erase data it has stored about you at any time.  At any point in a conversation, you can tell one of our Chatbots to "please delete my record".

Upon recieving the "please delete my record" instruction, all data which our system has collected about you related to this Chatbot will be deleted.  You will recieve a confirmation response "Memory has been erased."

Be advised that users of our system have some options to replicate data in and out of our Chatbot's Knowledge Base.

If you have any questions about our privacy, please follow up with an email to [privacy@dataskeptic.com](mailto:privacy@dataskeptic.com).
