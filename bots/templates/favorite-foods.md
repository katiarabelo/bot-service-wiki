# Favorite Foods Bot

This Bot has some strong opinions about food items.  It would like to ask you some questions to learn about your food preferences.  Perhaps you can find common ground on what you'd eat if you met up for dinner.

TODO: Bot begins with Attribute Set of:
    likes = { apples, blueberries, cherries, bagels, yogurt }
    dislikes = { bananas, peppers, pasta, tomatoes }

Bot will ask them what their favorite food is and build up a database.  This should demo the Attribute Set.  Can we do some sort of validation?  Like a wikidata check to make sure the item is a food item.  Maybe even translate everything bagel to match bagels?  Then this Bot could be a good template for demonstrating (at least) TWO features which would be great.  It could be referenced on two wiki pages then.
