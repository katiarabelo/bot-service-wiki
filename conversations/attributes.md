# Attributes

Any bit of information that you want your Bot to store in the Conversation State or in their Globals memory is considered an Attribute.  Attributes can take on many forms, but the most common is a key/value pair.

For example:

| Attribute | Value       |
|-----------|-------------|
| username  |  |
