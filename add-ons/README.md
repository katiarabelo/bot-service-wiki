# Add-ons

Our Chatbot platform is built to be modular and constantly expanding.  We do this by releasing new "add-ons" periodically which give Bots new functionality.

Add-ons are assigned to specific Bots.  Each one will create a new left menu tab on your Bot Detail page.


## Popular add-ons

* [Globals](globals/) - Create variables that your Bot can use in dynamic conversations.  This is a great way for you to centralize all bits of information that might need to be updated like a limited time offer, a physical address, or seasonal details.

* [Machine Learning Pipeline](ml-pipeline/) - Provide a corpus of example responses and we will use our custom machine learning pipeline to build a model which can be used by your Chatbot as a Route.
